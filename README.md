Home page for the application which lists all reservations made on a given day, all tables which can be either "free" or "occupied", and you are able to "seat" a reservation at a table, making that table now occupied. You are not able to create a reservation in the past. You are also not able to "seat" a reservation at a table that does not have sufficient capacity. 

You are able to edit a reservation and change any of the components you need to, including name, phone number, party size, date, and time of your reservation.

Tables can be marked as "finished" or "cancelled" where they will not longer show up on the dashboard screen.
