Home page for the application which lists all reservations made on a given day, all tables which can be either "free" or "occupied", and you are able to "seat" a reservation at a table, making that table now occupied. You are not able to create a reservation in the past. You are also not able to "seat" a reservation at a table that does not have sufficient capacity.
